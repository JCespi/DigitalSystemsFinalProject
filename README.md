# Final Project

This is the Arduino code for our final project. Here is a quick description of the code:
  - two ultrasonic sensors were connected directly to the arduino and code similar to that wrote in Lab 3 was used to receive their input
  - Physically, we cut the NeoPixels in half, essentially creating two NeoPixel strips that can be controlled with a single Data Input Pin, as reflected in the code.
  - There's a simple algorithm to determine which range of color a given distance (either port or starboard) lies in, and it is used to cycle through colors.
